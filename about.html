 <h2>About the Mapper</h2>
  <p style="width:50%">PRW Career Mapper is a web based data visualization tool created
  for researching the career of architect, Paul R. Williams, FAIA. PRW
  Career Mapper compiles the only three known published lists of
  Williams' building projects<sup>1</sup> and maps them based on date, location,
  use, and client type. The goal is to allow researchers a means of
  exploring what patterns, if any, existed in his career.</p>
  
  <p style="width:50%">It is purported that Williams undertook well over a thousand
  projects. Thus, the database displayed by the site is by no
  means complete. PRW Career Mapper is intended to serve as a
  living document under continuous revision. Suggestions,
  corrections, and additions are welcome.</p>

  Notes:
  <br>
  1. The following sources were used to create the
  project list. Best efforts were taken to reconcile discrepacies
  between project names and dates though there may still be
  errors. For the sake of consistency, we have chosen to date projects
  according to completion of construction.
